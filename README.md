# Simulated Cyber Attacks

A C# .NET Framework Cyber Attack Simulation Application for The Globe In My BucketList Application (TGIMBA)

This project was created to run simulated cyber attacks on the .NET version of TGBIMA.  These attacks target its User Interface (UI) using Selenium technologies, its Representational State Transfer (REST) and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services.  It is intended as a tool for learning simulated cyber attacks and how to prevent them.  This will only be used for localhost projects and never on external sites.  It is purely educational.
